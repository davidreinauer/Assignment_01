    <div><p>Blueberry Picking<br>
      Did you know there are 36 varieties of Michigan Blueberries?! Who knew something so small would come in so many flavors and sizes. Blueberry season has officially begun in West Michigan so here's a primer on when and where to pick your fill in the Holland area:

  Gold Barn Blueberries north of Holland plants a whopping 12 varieties of berries. Their full list with descriptions can be seen here.  Duke and Early Blue are early ripening varieties. Collin and Spartans are next. Spartan berries promise to be tangy-sweet and as large as a quarter! U-pick price is $1.45 per pound. 15985 Quincy St, 616-399-6267, M-Sa 8am-8pm.

  S. Kamphuis Blueberries is a fourth generation local grower. They plant Bluecrop, Blueray, and Jersey. Jerseys are smaller berries but super sweet and great for baking. Kamphuis also has a farm store with jams, blueberries treats, and blueberry frozen yogurt which is especially good after a hot day in the field. U-pick price is $1.60 per pound. 4140 - 148th Avenue, 616-399-9545, M-F 9am-8pm.

  Bowerman's Blueberries is new to the U-pick market this year. They plant Bluecrop. Bowerman's also has a farm store with fresh vegetables, raspberries, and like-you've-never-had-before blueberry donuts. U-pick price is $1.60 per pound. 15793 James Street, 616-738-3099, M-Sa 8am-8pm, Su 10am-5pm.

  Wa-Hu Blueberry Farm on Greenly Street plants Duke, Nelson, Blue Ray and Jersey. U-pick price is $1.35 per pound. 15411 Greenly Street, 616-218-3691, M-Fr 9:30am-4pm.

  Kenny Garden Farms has been growing blueberries since 1948. 15586 Greenly St, 616-994-0447. W-Sa 10am-3pm.

  Blueberry season continues through mid-August depending on the weather and picking volumes. Several of these outlets have Facebook pages with updates on what is available to pick and when the season will be closing. Blueberries grow in full sun so don't forget the sunscreen and plenty of water!
